Camunda Cloud Console CLI to interact with Camunda Cloud Resources.

This repository contains a CLI tool to interact with your Camunda Cloud account via the command-line.

You can create a Camunda Cloud Account here: https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup

and Create a new client. 
You need to copy and save the Client Id and the Secret Id from that client. 

You need to export the following variables for this command to interact with a Camunda Cloud Account:
  - export CC_CLIENT_ID=`<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - export CC_CLIENT_SECRET=`<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`
  
  Available Commands:  
  
  **List all clusters**
  `cc-ctl clusters get --all`

  **Get cluster from id**
  `cc-ctl clusters get --id <cluster_id>`

  **Get cluster from name**

  **Delete cluster from id**
  `cc-ctl clusters delete --id <cluster_id>`
